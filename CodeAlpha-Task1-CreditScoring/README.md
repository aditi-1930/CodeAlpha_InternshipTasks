## 📊 Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** German Credit Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Records:** 1000
- **Features:** 20
- **Target Variable:** Credit Risk  
  - `1` → Good Credit  
  - `0` → Bad Credit  

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

---

## 🔄 Methodology
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Encoded categorical features using One-Hot Encoding
3. Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained classification models
6. Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

---

## 📈 Results
- **Logistic Regression Accuracy:** 79.5%
- **Random Forest Accuracy:** 75.5%

Logistic Regression performed better after feature scaling, indicating largely linear relationships in the data.

---

## 📌 Conclusion
The Logistic Regression model achieved the best performance and was selected as the final model for credit risk prediction.
