# Task 4: Disease Prediction from Medical Data 🏥

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a disease based on structured medical data using machine learning classification techniques. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis by analyzing patient health attributes and generating accurate predictions.

This task is completed as part of the **CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship – Task 4**.
